Lookup remote in stack handleOneRx by using packet.index since it already
substitutes ha if se is zero. Then also lookup remote in haRemotes if not found
in .uidRemotes

Update joinent transaction

Change the way persistence reaping is handled. Instead of removing remote from
memory, mark it with .reaped attribute. This avoide problematic use case of

Update .manage

Also unreap anytime a packet is received from a remote

sender is unique name of remote yard that sent the message


---------
20140708
---------

v0.2.00

Ephemeral Lane Yards
Yards now use a uuid for the session id so that there is no need to persist
any Lane data in order to resolve ambiguous multi-page messages should one

---------

v0.0.15

Added persistence to Lanes of Yard info. Add some unit tests
Had to make quite a few changes to accomodate this with naming of Yard persistence
files and directories since multiple LaneStacks on same host using same yard

point will refactor to use simpler libnacl high level interface




---------
20140523

Raet now has basic support for persistence. This is through the Aliver and Alivent
transactions and inddicated by the state of RemoteEstate.alived attribute
RoadStack objects now have a .manage method that is responsible for kicking off

The result is to mark the .alived property as True if communication is successful
with the target of the transaction.
